	<p>The woman in the painting is wearing a flowing white dress. A large piece of 
	   intricately patterned fabric is draped over the side. In her right hand she holds 
	   the chain mooring the boat. Her expression is mournful. She stares at a crucifix 
	   lying in front of her. Beside it are three candles. Two have blown out.</p>
